Here is a makefile that you can call for testing out general functionality of the system calls. It doesn't test out multithreading and functionality between threads. However, it does include all the calls.

Use the Makefile by calling:

make all

Then run the add, remove, and genTest executables:

./add
./remove
./genTest
