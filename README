Linux Kernel with IPC mailbox implementation - in progress

I currently am prototyping the functionality for the mailbox system calls in the proj1proto directory, and have addition, deletion, searching, and sending of messages working. Hopefully will be done with rest of the functions soon and will be working on locking.
