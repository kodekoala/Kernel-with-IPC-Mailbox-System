Linux Kernel with IPC mailbox implementation 

I have successfully implemented the prototype in proj1proto, which can be run with the makefile in its directory.

I then implemented the system calls based on the prototype, in proj1IPC. I made the necessary changes to the kernel, and it compiles successfully.

I added rwlocking, though I have not tested it extensively - however no deadlocking is observed.
